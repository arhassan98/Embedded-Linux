# Header File Parser

This Python program parses a header file and extracts all function prototypes from it. The function prototypes are then inserted into an Excel sheet with a unique ID starting with "IDX0".

## Dependencies

This program requires the following dependencies to be installed:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- pycparser

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```shell
pip install pandas pycparser
```

## Usage

To run the program, use the following command:

```shell
python parse_header_file.py header_file.h
```

Replace `parse_header_file.py` with the actual name of the Python script file, and `header_file.h` with the path to the header file you want to parse.

## Program Flow

1. The program first preprocesses the header file using the GCC preprocessor to remove preprocessor directives.

2. The preprocessed header code is then parsed using pycparser, a C parser library for Python.

3. The program traverses the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generated by pycparser to find function prototypes.

4. For each function prototype, a unique ID is assigned, and the function's return type and name are extracted.

5. The extracted function prototypes are stored in a pandas DataFrame with columns "ID", "Return Type", and "Function Name".

6. The DataFrame is saved as an Excel file with the same name as the header file, but with the extension ".xlsx".

7. The program outputs a message indicating the successful extraction and saving of function prototypes.

Note: If any errors occur during preprocessing or parsing, appropriate error messages are displayed.

## Example

Here's an example usage of the program:

```shell
python parse_header_file.py header_file.h
```

Assuming the header file "header_file.h" contains function prototypes, the program will extract them and save them to "header_file.h.xlsx".

```
Function prototypes extracted and saved to 'header_file.h.xlsx'.
```
```

Make sure to replace `parse_header_file.py` with the actual name of the Python script file, and `header_file.h` with the path to your own header file.
