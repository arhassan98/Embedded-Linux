# Filling an Array Sequentially

This program demonstrates how to fill an integer array with sequential values ranging from 10 to 10,000. It uses a for loop to populate the array elements.

## Usage

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable file.

## Description

The program declares an integer array `sequentialArray` with a size of 9991. This size is calculated to store sequential values ranging from 10 to 10,000. Each element of the array will hold a sequential value.

A for loop is used to fill the array sequentially. The loop starts from 0 and iterates up to `arraySize - 1` (9990 in this case). Inside the loop, each element of the array is assigned a value by adding the loop variable `i` to 10.

After the array is filled, a message is displayed indicating that the array has been filled sequentially from 10 to 10,000.

You can now use the `sequentialArray` for further operations or processing as needed.
