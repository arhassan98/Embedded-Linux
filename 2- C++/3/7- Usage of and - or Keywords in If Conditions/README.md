# Usage of "and" and "or" Keywords in If Conditions

This program demonstrates how to use the "and" and "or" keywords (logical operators) in if conditions to perform conditional checks involving multiple conditions.

## Usage

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable file.

## Description

The program declares two integer variables `x` and `y` and assigns them the values 5 and 10, respectively.

The program then demonstrates the usage of the "and" keyword (logical AND) in an if condition. The condition checks whether `x` is less than 10 and `y` is greater than 5. If the condition is true, the program outputs a message indicating that the condition using the "and" keyword is true. Otherwise, it outputs a message indicating that the condition is false.

Next, the program demonstrates the usage of the "or" keyword (logical OR) in an if condition. The condition checks whether `x` is less than 10 or `y` is less than 5. If the condition is true, the program outputs a message indicating that the condition using the "or" keyword is true. Otherwise, it outputs a message indicating that the condition is false.

You can modify the values of `x` and `y` to observe different outcomes based on the condition checks.
